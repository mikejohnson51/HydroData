58,Yields of Irrigated Crops (Component),cocropyld,irryield_r,Float,NA,2,"These are the estimated average yields per acre that can be expected of selected irrigated crops under a high level of management. In any given year, yields may be higher or lower than those indicated because of variations in rainfall and other climatic factors. It is assumed that the irrigation system is adapted to the soils and to the crops grown, that good-quality irrigation water is uniformly applied as needed, and that tillage is kept to a minimum.

In the database, some states maintain crop yield data by individual map unit component and others maintain the data at the map unit level. Attributes are included in this application for both, although only one or the other is likely to have data for any given geographic area. This attribute uses data maintained at the map unit component level.

The yields are actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value for the component. For these yields, only the representative value is used.

The yields are based mainly on the experience and records of farmers, conservationists, and extension agents. Available yield data from nearby areas and results of field trials and demonstrations also are considered.

The management needed to obtain the indicated yields of the various crops depends on the kind of soil and the crop. Management can include drainage, erosion control, and protection from flooding; the proper planting and seeding rates; suitable high-yielding crop varieties; appropriate and timely tillage; control of weeds, plant diseases, and harmful insects; favorable soil reaction and optimum levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements for each crop; effective use of crop residue, barnyard manure, and green manure crops; and harvesting that ensures the smallest possible loss.

The CPI consists of  a numerical value that range from 0.00 to 1.00.  The greater the CPI value, the higher is the predicted productivity for small grains. A  narrative rating is also assigned, based on the CPI value as follows:

Low - less than or equal to 0.20
Moderately low - 0.21 to 0.40
Moderate - 0.41 to 0.60
Moderately high - 0.61 to 0.80
High - greater than or equal to 0.81

The criteria for the small grains crop productivity index were developed by a team of soil scientists and agronomists familiar with the soils, crops, and crop production practices in Major Land Resource Area 9.  The team used the framework of the National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (NCCPI) as a starting point, and modified it for local soil and climatic conditions.  More information on the NCCPI is available at: 
ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/NCCPI/NCCPI_user_guide.pdf

The criteria for the small grains crop productivity index are grouped into five categories: soil physical properties, soil chemical properties, climate, landscape, and soil water.  

Soil physical properties include bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, linear extensibility, rock fragment content, and depth to root-restricting layers.  

Soil chemical properties include organic matter content, sodium adsorption ratio, electrical conductivity, pH, and cation exchange capacity.  

Climate properties include the number of frost-free days, and mean annual precipitation.  

Landscape criteria include steepness of slope, stones and boulders on the soil surface, depth and duration of the water table during the growing season, flooding frequency and duration during the growing season, and ponding frequency and duration during the growing season. 

The soil water criterion is based on the available water capacity.",,,Interpretation,"CPI - Small Grains, NIRR - Palouse Prairies (OR)",2,Not rated,0,1,0,0,,0,,,-1,CPIsg,,,,,,,,0,,NA,NA,Centimeters,0,,,Weighted Average,0,0,,1,5,NA,"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""5""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Low"" label=""Low"" order=""1""><Color red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Moderately low"" label=""Moderately low"" order=""2""><Color red=""255"" green=""127"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Moderate"" label=""Moderate"" order=""3""><Color red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Moderately high"" label=""Moderately high"" order=""4""><Color red=""127"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""High"" label=""High"" order=""5""><Color red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>",149,04/30/2012 06:29:39,Dominant Condition,NA,1,String

Corn suitability ratings (CSR2) provide a relative ranking of all soils mapped in the State of Iowa according to their potential for the intensive production of row crops. The CSR2 is an index that can be used to rate the potential yield of one soil against that of another over a period of time. Considered in the ratings are average weather conditions and frequency of use of the soil for row crops. Ratings range from 100 for soils that have no physical limitations, occur on minimal slopes, and can be continuously row cropped to as low as 5 for soils that are severely limited for the production of row crops.

2660,Minnesota Crop Productivity Index,mutext,text,Narrative Text,NA,NA,"The Minnesota Crop Productivity Index (CPI) ratings provide a relative ranking of soils based on their potential for intensive row crop production.  An index can be used to rate the potential yield of one soil against that of another over a period of time.  Ratings range from 0 to 100.  The higher numbers indicate higher production potential.

The CPI ratings do not take into account climatic factors, such as the differences in precipitation or growing degree days across Minnesota.  The ratings are based on physical and chemical properties of the soils and on such hazards and flooding and ponding.  Available water capacity, reaction (pH), slopes, soil moisture status, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter content, salinity, and surface fragments are the major properties evaluated when CPI ratings are generated.  The soil properties selected are those that are important for the production of corn.

All map units in Minnesota were initially evaluated using the Cropland Productivity rule in the National Soil Information System (NASIS).  They were assigned a value using an overall CPI based on the combined properties and characteristics of the map unit as a whole, and the values were adjusted based on tacit knowledge of local experts.  An individual map unit (for example, Canisteo clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes) will have the same CPI value wherever that map unit occurs throughout the state.

When the soils are rated, the following assumptions are made:  a) adequate management, b) no irrigation, c) artificial drainage where required, d) no land leveling or terracing, and e) no climatic factors considered. 

The map unit CPI was used to update the map unit crop yields for corn and soybeans.

40,"Lawns, Landscaping, and Golf Fairways",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates soils for their use in establishing and maintaining turf for lawns and golf fairways and ornamental trees and shrubs for residential or commercial landscaping. Lawns and landscaping require soils on which turf and ornamental trees and shrubs can be established and maintained. Golf fairways are subject to heavy foot traffic and some light vehicular traffic. Cutting or filling may be required. 

The ratings are based on the use of soil material at the site, which may have been altered by some land smoothing. Irrigation may or may not be needed and is not a criterion in rating. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect plant growth and trafficability after vegetation is established. The properties that affect plant growth are reaction; depth to a water table; ponding; depth to bedrock or a cemented pan; the available water capacity in the upper 40 inches; the content of salts, sodium, or calcium carbonate; and sulfidic materials. The properties that affect trafficability are flooding, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, stoniness, and the amount of sand, clay, or organic matter in the surface layer. The suitability of the soil for traps, tees, roughs, and greens is not considered in the ratings.

Not considered in the ratings, but important in evaluating a site, are the location and accessibility of the area, the size and shape of the area and its scenic quality, vegetation, access to water, potential water impoundment sites, and access to public sewer lines. Soils that are subject to flooding are limited by the duration and intensity of flooding and the season when flooding occurs. In planning for lawns, landscaping, or golf fairways, onsite assessment of the height, duration, intensity, and frequency of flooding is essential.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

The ratings are based on the soil properties that influence the ease of digging and the resistance to sloughing. Depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, the amount of large stones, and dense layers influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting. Depth to the seasonal high water table, flooding, and ponding may restrict the period when excavations can be made. Slope influences the ease of using machinery. Soil texture, depth to the water table, and linear extensibility (shrink-swell potential) influence the resistance to sloughing.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.

Unpaved local roads and streets are those roads and streets that carry traffic year round but have a graded surface of local soil material or aggregate. 
The roads and streets consist of
(1) the underlying local soil material, either cut or fill, which is called ""the sub-grade"";
(2) the surface, which may be the same as the subgrade or may have aggrate such as crushed limestone added.

They are graded to shed water, and conventional drainage measures are provided.  These roads and streets are built mainly from the soil at the site. Soil interpretations for local roads and streets are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use. Soil properties and qualities that affect local roads and streets are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.

Toxic substances, soil reaction, and the properties that are inferred from soil texture, such as available water capacity and fertility, affect plant growth. The ease of excavating, loading, and spreading is affected by rock fragments, slope, depth to a water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material. Reclamation of the borrow area is affected by slope, depth to a water table, rock fragments, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and toxic material.

When these areas are reclaimed, layers of soil material or unconsolidated geological material, or both, are replaced in a vertical sequence. The reconstructed soil favors plant growth. The ratings do not apply to quarries or other mined areas that require an offsite source of reconstruction material. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect erosion and stability of the surface and the productive potential of the reclaimed soil. These properties include the content of sodium, salts, and calcium carbonate; reaction; available water capacity; erodibility; texture; content of rock fragments; and content of organic matter and other features that affect fertility.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of reclamation material. The ratings are based on the amount of suitable material and on soil properties that affect the ease of excavation and the performance of the material after it is in place. The thickness of the suitable material is a major consideration. The ease of excavation is affected by large stones, depth to a water table, and slope. How well the soil performs in place after it has been compacted and drained is determined by its strength (as inferred from the AASHTO classification of the soil) and linear extensibility (shrink-swell potential). Normal compaction, minor processing, and other standard construction practices are assumed.

When the material is properly used in reclamation, a rating of ""good"" means that establishing and maintaining vegetation are relatively easy, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reclaimed soil has good potential productivity. A rating of ""fair"" means that vegetation can be established and maintained and the soil can be stabilized through modification of one or more properties. For satisfactory performance, it may be necessary to topdress with better suited material or add soil amendments. A rating of ""poor"" means that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly. To establish and maintain vegetation, it is necessary to topdress with better suited material.

137,Sand Source (OR),cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Sand is a natural aggregate (0.05 millimeter to 2 millimeters in diameter) suitable for commercial use with a minimum of processing. It is used in many kinds of construction. Specifications for each use vary widely. Only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity is evaluated. The suitability of the material for specific purposes is not evaluated, nor are factors that affect excavation of the material.

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a source of sand are gradation of grain sizes (as indicated by the Unified classification of the soil), the thickness of suitable material, and the content of rock fragments. If the bottom layer of the soil contains sand, the soil is considered a likely source regardless of thickness. The assumption is that the sand layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness. The ratings are for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 6 feet.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of sand. A rating of ""good"" or ""fair"" means that sand is likely to be in or below the soil. The bottom layer and the thickest layer of the soil are assigned numerical ratings. These ratings indicate the likelihood that the layer is a source of sand. The number 0.00 indicates that the layer is a ""poor source."" The number 1.00 indicates that the layer is a ""good source."" A number between 0.00 and 1.00 indicates the degree to which the layer is a likely source.

The upper 40 inches of a soil is evaluated for use as topsoil. Also evaluated is the reclamation potential of the borrow area. The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of topsoil. Normal compaction, minor processing, and other standard construction practices are assumed.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect plant growth; the ease of excavating, loading, and spreading the material; and reclamation of the borrow area. Toxic substances, soil reaction, and the properties that are inferred from soil texture, such as available water capacity and fertility, affect plant growth. The ease of excavating, loading, and spreading is affected by rock fragments, slope, depth to a water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material. Reclamation of the borrow area is affected by slope, depth to a water table, rock fragments, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and toxic material.

Numerical ratings between 0.00 and 0.99 are given after the specified features. These numbers indicate the degree to which the features limit the soils as sources of topsoil. The lower the number, the greater the limitation.

The surface layer of most soils is generally preferred for topsoil because of its content of organic matter. Organic matter greatly increases the absorption and retention of moisture and nutrients for plant growth.

103,Daily Cover for Landfill,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Daily cover for landfill is the soil material that is used to cover compacted solid waste in a sanitary landfill. The soil material is obtained offsite, transported to the landfill, and spread over the waste. The ratings also apply to the final cover for a landfill. They are based on the soil properties that affect workability, the ease of digging, and the ease of moving and spreading the material over the refuse daily during wet and dry periods. These properties include soil texture, depth to a water table, ponding, rock fragments, slope, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, reaction, and content of salts, sodium, or lime.

Loamy or silty soils that are free of large stones and excess gravel are the best cover for a landfill. Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread; sandy soils are subject to wind erosion.

Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material. Also, it can influence runoff, erosion, and reclamation of the borrow area. 

The soil material used as the final cover for a landfill should be suitable for plants. It should not have excess sodium, salts, or lime and should not be too acid. After soil material has been removed, the soil material remaining in the borrow area must be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table to permit revegetation. Some damage to the borrow area is expected, however, and plant growth may not be optimum.

This information is intended for land use planning, for evaluating land use alternatives, and for planning site investigations prior to design and construction. The information, however, has limitations. For example, estimates and other data generally apply only to that part of the soil between the surface and a depth of 5 to 7 feet. Because of the map scale, small areas of different soils may be included within the mapped areas of a specific soil.

The information is not site specific and does not eliminate the need for onsite investigation of the soils or for testing and analysis by personnel experienced in the design and construction of engineering works.

Government ordinances and regulations that restrict certain land uses or impose specific design criteria were not considered in preparing the ratings. Local ordinances and regulations should be considered in planning, in site selection, and in design.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.

90,Sanitary Landfill (Trench),cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"A ""trench sanitary landfill"" is an area where solid waste is placed in successive layers in an excavated trench. The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil excavated at the site. When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill. A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic. It can result in the pollution of ground water. Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the risk of pollution, the ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation. These properties include saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, flooding, texture, stones and boulders, highly organic layers, soil reaction, and content of salts and sodium. Unless otherwise stated, the ratings apply only to that part of the soil within a depth of about 6 feet. For deeper trenches, onsite investigation may be needed.

Hard, nonrippable bedrock, creviced bedrock, or highly permeable strata at or directly below the proposed trench bottom can affect the ease of excavation and the hazard of ground-water pollution. Slope affects construction of the trenches and the movement of surface water around the landfill. It also affects the construction and performance of roads in areas of the landfill.

Soil texture and consistence affect the ease with which the trench is dug and the ease with which the soil can be used as daily or final cover. They determine the workability of the soil when dry and when wet. Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and are difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.

The soil material used as the final cover for a trench landfill should be suitable for plants. It should not have excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid. The surface layer generally has the best workability, the highest content of organic matter, and the best potential for plants. Material from the surface layer should be stockpiled for use as the final cover.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use.

84,Sewage Lagoons,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic bacteria decompose the solid and liquid wastes. Lagoons should have a nearly level floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted soil. Nearly impervious soil material for the lagoon floor and sides is required to minimize seepage and contamination of ground water. Considered in the ratings are slope, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, large stones, and content of organic matter.

Ksat is a critical property affecting the suitability for sewage lagoons. Most porous soils eventually become sealed when they are used as sites for sewage lagoons. Until sealing occurs, however, the hazard of pollution is severe. Soils that have a Ksat rate of more than 14 micrometers per second are too porous for the proper functioning of sewage lagoons. In these soils, seepage of the effluent can result in contamination of the ground water. Ground-water contamination is also a hazard if fractured bedrock is within a depth of 40 inches, if the water table is high enough to raise the level of sewage in the lagoon, or if floodwater overtops the lagoon.

A high content of organic matter is detrimental to proper functioning of the lagoon because it inhibits aerobic activity. Slope, bedrock, and cemented pans can cause construction problems, and large stones can hinder compaction of the lagoon floor. If the lagoon is to be uniformly deep throughout, the slope must be gentle enough and the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make land smoothing practical.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.

62,Sanitary Landfill (Area),cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"In an ""area sanitary landfill,"" solid waste is placed in successive layers on the surface of the soil. The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil from a source away from the site. A final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the completed landfill. A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic. It can result in the pollution of ground water. Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect trafficability and the risk of pollution. These properties include flooding, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, slope, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan. Flooding is a serious problem because it can result in pollution in areas downstream from the landfill. If Ksat is too rapid or if fractured bedrock, a fractured cemented pan, or the water table is close to the surface, the leachate can contaminate the water supply. Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading required to maintain roads in the steeper areas of the landfill. Also, leachate may flow along the surface of the soils in the steeper areas and cause difficult seepage problems.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.

18,Septic Tank Absorption Fields,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Septic tank absorption fields are areas in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. Only that part of the soil between depths of 24 and 60 inches is evaluated. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption of the effluent, construction and maintenance of the system, and public health. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and flooding affect absorption of the effluent. Stones and boulders, ice, and bedrock or a cemented pan interfere with installation. Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance. Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in downslope areas.

Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth of less than 4 feet below the distribution lines. In these soils the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new. As a result, the ground water may become contaminated.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use.

526,Soil-Based Residential Wastewater Disposal Ratings (VT),mapunit,vtsepticsyscl,Choice,254,NA,"This interpretation indicates the suitability of the soils for soil-based residential wastewater disposal systems. The ratings are based on the 2007 Vermont Environmental Protection Rules (Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, Agency of Natural Resources). This rating system replaces the system in the publication ""Ancillary Soil Interpretation Ratings for On-site Sewage Disposal in Vermont,"" published in January 1997 by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Included in soil-based wastewater disposal systems are absorption fields, also known as leach fields, or trenches in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. There must be unsaturated soil material beneath the absorption field to filter the effluent effectively. Unsatisfactory performance, including excessively slow absorption of effluent, surfacing of effluent, and hillside seepage, can affect public health.

The ratings are represented by symbols for five interpretive groups and their subgroups. These groups and subgroups are described in the following paragraphs.

Group I soils are well suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. The soils in this group are sandy and gravelly soils that formed in outwash and that have rapid permeability in the substratum and well drained soils that formed in till and that have a friable substratum with moderate permeability. Slopes generally are less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ia have rapid permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ib have rapid permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ic have moderate permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Id have moderate permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.

Group II soils are moderately suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes soils with moderately slow to very slow permeability; complexes in which one or more of the soils have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches); soils that would qualify for inclusion in group I but have slopes of more than 20 percent; and soils that have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIa have moderately slow to very slow permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIb have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIc have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) in some areas and have slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IId have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIe have rapid permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIf have moderate permeability and slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIh have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more and have slopes of less than 20 percent.

Group III map units are marginally suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Intensive onsite investigation may be needed to locate suitable areas, or special design, extra maintenance, or costly alteration may be needed to overcome the soil-related limitations. In areas where the water table is at a shallow depth, seasonal onsite monitoring of the water table may be needed to determine whether the site is suitable. Some areas of any of the map units in group III may not be suitable for soil-based wastewater disposal systems.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIa have bedrock at a depth of less than 10 inches in some areas. Some map units are limited by slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIb are subject to flooding and have a seasonal high water table at a moderate depth.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIc have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 percent or less.
     •   	Map units in subgroup IIId have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 to 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIe generally have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 2 feet and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIf have a seasonal high water table and limited depth to bedrock. Some map units have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIg have a flooding hazard.

Group IV map units are generally not suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems because of such limitations as wetness, depth to bedrock, restricted permeability, and slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVa are subject to excessive wetness.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVb are limited by the depth to bedrock and by slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVc are generally not suited because of a very limited depth to bedrock and the slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVd have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent. Some map units have a seasonal high water table.

Group V map units are not rated for soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes miscellaneous areas that have been filled, excavated, regraded, or otherwise disturbed by human activities; areas that are mapped above the series level, such as Udorthents; and areas of water. The miscellaneous areas and the areas mapped above the series level have a wide range of soil properties. Onsite investigation is needed to determine the suitability of these areas for soil-based wastewater disposal.

These ratings are based on the installation of a new septic system for a new single-family home on a lot subdivided on or after June 14, 2002, in a municipality that has planning and zoning bylaws. The ratings do not necessarily apply to the siting of a replacement system for an existing residence. The ratings for lots subdivided before June 14, 2002, are based on a slope limitation of 30 percent, whereas the ratings in this interpretation are based on a slope limitation of 20 percent. The ratings in this interpretation do not take into consideration some site factors that can affect the placement of septic systems, such as wellhead and source protection areas, isolation distances, and the size of the parcel.
This interpretation is intended for general planning purposes only and is not intended to replace or supersede the need for an onsite soil investigation. These ratings apply only to land within the State of Vermont.",,,Property,,NA,,1,0,0,0,,0,,,-1,SBRWDR,,,,,,,,0,,NA,NA,Centimeters,0,,,Weighted Average,0,0,,1,2,NA,"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Ia"" label=""Ia"" order=""1""><Color red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Ib"" label=""Ib"" order=""2""><Color red=""44"" green=""188"" blue=""20"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Ic"" label=""Ic"" order=""3""><Color red=""27"" green=""118"" blue=""12"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Id"" label=""Id"" order=""4""><Color red=""187"" green=""239"" blue=""196"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIa"" label=""IIa"" order=""5""><Color red=""158"" green=""145"" blue=""50"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIb"" label=""IIb"" order=""6""><Color red=""239"" green=""250"" blue=""176"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIc"" label=""IIc"" order=""7""><Color red=""239"" green=""250"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IId"" label=""IId"" order=""8""><Color red=""166"" green=""197"" blue=""11"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIe"" label=""IIe"" order=""9""><Color red=""108"" green=""99"" blue=""34"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIf"" label=""IIf"" order=""10""><Color red=""214"" green=""194"" blue=""158"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIg"" label=""IIg"" order=""11""><Color red=""178"" green=""142"" blue=""76"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIh"" label=""IIh"" order=""12""><Color red=""175"" green=""113"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIa"" label=""IIIa"" order=""13""><Color red=""245"" green=""153"" blue=""77"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIb"" label=""IIIb"" order=""14""><Color red=""232"" green=""113"" blue=""14"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIc"" label=""IIIc"" order=""15""><Color red=""189"" green=""92"" blue=""11"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIId"" label=""IIId"" order=""16""><Color red=""249"" green=""208"" blue=""153"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIe"" label=""IIIe"" order=""17""><Color red=""246"" green=""99"" blue=""8"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIf"" label=""IIIf"" order=""18""><Color red=""251"" green=""180"" blue=""137"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IIIg"" label=""IIIg"" order=""19""><Color red=""207"" green=""136"" blue=""117"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVa"" label=""IVa"" order=""20""><Color red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVb"" label=""IVb"" order=""21""><Color red=""243"" green=""150"" blue=""141"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVc"" label=""IVc"" order=""22""><Color red=""190"" green=""93"" blue=""62"" /></Labels><Labels value=""IVd"" label=""IVd"" order=""23""><Color red=""226"" green=""96"" blue=""96"" /></Labels><Labels value=""V"" label=""V"" order=""24""><Color red=""220"" green=""48"" blue=""220"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>",1,12/29/2011 07:52:58,No Aggregation Necessary,NA,1,Choice
453,Rangeland Drill,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation provides a rating of each for its suitability for using a rangeland drill in a rangeland seeding operation.  Rangeland drill seeding is commonly practiced, often in combination with vegetation control techniques to revegetate depleted rangeland.  The rangeland drill was designed for treating rangeland by the USDA Forest Service Equipment Development Center at San Dimas, California.  It is a very heavy-duty, side-wheel drill featuring large wheels, a high-clearance reinforced frame, and single-disk openers that are independently suspended on trailing arms.  The trailing arms have skid plates underneath to prevent breakage.

The rangeland drill suitability ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of a rangeland drill.  This rating should be used in conjunction with the rangeland seeding rating to ensure that the potential treatment areas would respond favorably to seeding.  It is important to obtain the maximum benefit/cost ratio for expensive restoration/revegetation treatments.

Rock fragments and rock outcrop potentially damage the rangeland drill.  Steep slopes limit the ability to safely operate a rangeland drill along the contour.  High clay content reduces the effectiveness of the rangeland drill and ability to operate equipment during wet soil conditions.  Too sandy surface textures reduce the effectiveness of the rangeland drill.  Ponding, flooding, and high water table affect the timing of rangeland drill seeding by limiting access to the treatment area.  On-sight investigation is recommended before implementing any rangeland drill seeding projects.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the suitability of soil material for the use.  ""Well suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for this use. Good performance can be expected. ""Moderately suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are favorable for this use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance can be expected. ""Poorly suited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for this use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance can be expected.

The overall rating class for each soil is assigned based on the product of the numerical ratings of the individual soil properties considered in the interpretation, some of which may not be displayed.

Numerical ratings indicate the level of suitability of the soil for use of the rangeland drill.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01.

455,"Rangeland Seeding, Great Basin Ecoregion",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates each soil for its suitability for rangeland seeding and establishing a successful seeding.  Rangeland seeding is commonly practiced in combination with vegetation control techniques to revegetate depleted rangeland.  Rangeland seeding may be accomplished using a rangeland drill, or broadcast seeding using aerial or ground equipment.  Criteria used in this interpretation are applicable to the Great Basin Ecoregion of the Western U.S.

Low precipitation, shallow rooting depth, excess salt, and excess sodium reduce the probability of establishing a successful seeding.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the suitability of soil material for rangeland seeding.  ""Well suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for this use and that a successful seeding can be expected in 8 or more years out of 10.  A wide variety of grass, forb, and shrub species are well adapted to seeding on that site and a high potential forage production level can be anticipated.  The benefit/cost ratios are favorable and these sites should be given primary consideration for rangeland restoration seeding.

""Moderately Suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are favorable for this use and that a successful seeding can be anticipated in 6 or 7 years out of 10.  A limited number of plant species are adapted to seeding on the site and a moderate potential forage production level can be achieved.  Benefit/cost ratios are somewhat reduced, but may still be favorable.  These soils should be given secondary consideration for rangeland restoration seeding.

""Poorly suited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for this use and that a successful seeding can be expected in 4 or 5 years out of 10.  Only a few plant species are adapted to seeding on these soils and a fairly low potential forage production level can be anticipated.  Benefit/cost ratios will be poor.  These sites have a low seeding potential, and it's recommended that they only be considered for restoration seeding if they occur in a mapping unit complex with more favorable soils.  Emergency seeding after fire for erosion control may be justified though.

The overall rating class for each soil is assigned based on the product of the numerical ratings of the individual soil properties considered in the interpretation, some of which may not be displayed.

Numerical ratings indicate the level of suitability of the soil for chaining.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01.

456,Rangeland Tillage,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates each soil for its suitability for use of tillage equipment suitable for tilling rangeland ecological sites.  Tillage is the use of mechanized equipment to disturb and to mix the soil usually to a depth of 3 to 12 inches from the surface.  Rangeland tillage is commonly practiced in combination with seeding for rangeland restoration or revegetation.  Plowing or discing is used to reduce the competition of sagebrush, and to a lesser extent, rabbitbrush, greasewood, and annual or perennial herbaceous plants that are considered undesirable.  This treatment also helps remove compacted layers, improve soil tilth, and prepare a firm, friable seedbed for subsequent seeding operations.

Rangeland tillage is usually performed with a brushland plow; wheatland (one-way disc) plow; extra heavy-duty, offset disc; or chisel plow.  The brushland plow's rugged construction and independently spring-loaded discs allow it to be used on rough, moderately stony or rocky sites without undue breakage.  The wheatland plow is best suited to gentle slopes that are relatively free of stones and rock outcrop.  The extra heavy-duty, offset disc is well adapted to use on compact, heavy textured soils.  Chisel plows are used to control weeds, break up compacted soils, and increase water infiltration while leaving plant residue on the soil surface to reduce erosion.  A wide variety of chisel points, sweeps, and shovels are available to accomplish desired tillage.

This rating should be used in conjunction with the rangeland seeding rating to ensure that the potential treatment areas would respond favorably to seeding.  It is important to obtain the maximum benefit/cost ratio for expensive restoration/revegetation treatments.

Steep slopes limit the ability to safely operate these implements along the contour.  Plowing up and down slope accelerates water erosion whereas plowing along the contour reduces water erosion.  Sandy soils on gentle slopes susceptible to wind erosion should be plowed perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan restricts the capability to do deep plowing.  Stones and rock outcrop potentially damage and hinder the operation of the equipment.  Ponding, flooding, and high water table affect the timing of tillage by limiting access to the site.  High clay content reduces effectiveness of the tillage implements.  On-sight investigation is recommended before implementing any rangeland tillage projects.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the suitability of soil material for the use.  ""Well suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for this use. Good performance can be expected. ""Moderately suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are favorable for this use. Fair performance can be expected.

457,Site Degradation Susceptibility,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates each soil for its susceptibility for soil degradation to occur during disturbance, which is a function of resistance to degradation.  Resistance to degradation of a rangeland or woodland site is a measure of its ability to function without change throughout a disturbance.  The magnitude of decline in the capacity to function determines the degree of resistance to change.  Resistance to degradation thus could be described as an area's buffering capacity.  This depends upon soil type, vegetation, climate, land use, disturbance regime, temporal and spatial scales.  The disturbance regime determines the type of stresses placed upon the soil, vegetation, and wildlife components of the site.  Thus, soil factors of vulnerability will vary based upon the disturbance regime for a particular site.

The ratings represent the relative risk of water and wind erosion, salinization, sodification, organic matter and nutrient depletion and/or redistribution, and loss of adequate rooting depth to maintain desired plant communities.  Dynamic soil properties which vary with time, e.g. microbial biomass/diversity and carbon/nitrogen ratio, are not used since they are not contained within the soil database.

Steep slopes increase the potential for water erosion.  Shallow rooting depth, and excess salt or sodium can reduce plant diversity, resistance to stress, and seedling survival.

This rating should be used with the objective to protect vulnerable sites from the type of degradation that would result in accelerated erosion, reduction in water and air quality, invasion by annual grasses or noxious weeds, and other large scale potential natural plant community conversions.  When degradation of soil and natural plant community characteristics goes beyond the threshold for the ecological site, the ecological site characteristics cannot be restored without artificial restoration efforts.

There may be unique circumstances where accelerated soil processes that are normally considered contributing to site degradation are actually beneficial to some attribute of the site, such as Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides) being more competitive in shifting sands than most species.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the potential for degradation. ""Highly susceptible"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are very favorable for degradation. ""Moderately susceptible"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for damage to occur. ""Slightly susceptible"" indicates that the soil has features that generally make it unfavorable for degradation to occur. 

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

458,Soil Compaction Resistance,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates each soil for its resistance to compaction.  Compaction tends to reduce water infiltration which affects plant production and composition, increases runoff which generally increased erosion rates, and affects organisms living within the soil.

Compaction is predominantly influenced by moisture content, depth to saturation, percent of sand, silt, and clay, soil structure, organic matter content, and content of coarse fragments.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the suitability of soil material for chaining.  ""High resistance"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable to resisting compaction. ""Moderate resistance"" indicates that the soil has features that are favorable to resisting compaction. ""Low resistance"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that favor the formation of a compacted layer. 

The overall rating class for each soil is assigned based on the product of the numerical ratings of the individual soil properties considered in the interpretation, some of which may not be displayed.

459,Soil Restoration Potential,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates each soil for its inherent ability to recover from degradation, which is often referred to as soil resilience.  The ability to recover from degradation means the ability to restore functional and structural integrity after a disturbance.  Both the rate and degree of recovery need to be considered.  Soil functions that are important include sustaining biological activity, diversity and productivity; capture, storage and release of water; storing and cycling nutrients and other elements; filtering, buffering, degrading, immobilizing and detoxifying contaminants; providing support for plant and animal life; and protection for archeological sites.  Restoration goals may include re-establishment of a preferred natural plant assemblage of the ecological site that existed prior to decline to a degraded state.

Soil resilience is dependent upon adequate stores of organic matter, good soil structure, low salt and sodium levels, adequate nutrient levels, microbial biomass and diversity, adequate precipitation for recovery, and other soil properties.  Dynamic soil properties, such as microbial biomass and diversity or carbon nitrogen ratio, are not used for this rating since they are not contained within the soil database.

This rating should be used to help prioritize areas for restoration projects, such as prescribed burning, chaining, or herbicide application, that depend upon natural vegetation recovery.  On-site investigation is recommended before undertaking any restoration project.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the soil's ability to recover.

The ratings are general in nature, and are designed to be used in the planning process to identify areas with a high vulnerability to invasion by yellow star-thistle.  This allows the user to plan and develop management practices that will reduce the probability of yellow star-thistle invasion.

Yellow star-thistle (Centaurea solstitialis L) is an introduced, winter annual forb that is a major concern to range ecologists, wildlife biologists, recreationists, and the livestock industry.  It is an aggressive invader of disturbed or poor condition rangeland sites that can suppress desirable, native vegetation.  Yellow star-thistle has low palatability and nutritional value for livestock and most wildlife species, is toxic to horses, and it can increase wildfire incidence in some dwarf sagebrush communities.  The seed is eaten by several species of birds.  The plant it is considered an important honey source plant in California and other western states.  Yellow star-thistle is listed as a noxious weed in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington.

The interpretations provide invasion vulnerability ratings and identify the dominant soil and site characteristics that influence the susceptibility of the site to yellow star-thistle invasion.  

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect soil invasion by yellow star-thistle. A rating of ""highly susceptible"" indicates the soils have a high susceptibility to yellow star-thistle invasion.  A ""moderately susceptible"" rating indicates that the site is moderately susceptible to yellow star-thistle invasion.  A ""slightly susceptible"" rating indicates that the soil characteristics may limit establishment of yellow star-thistle invasions.  Other factors, such as proximity to a seed source, also need to be considered in determining susceptibility to yellow star-thistle invasion.

452,Pygmy Rabbit Habitat Potential,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation is general in nature.  It provides suitability ratings and identifies the soil and dominant plant composition characteristics that influence the potential of the site for providing habitat for pygmy rabbits.  This information allows the user to plan and develop restoration efforts for pygmy rabbits.

Pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) are found in SE Washington, E Oregon, S Idaho, SW Montana, SW Wyoming, NE California, N Nevada, and W Utah.  Though the historical population and range of the pygmy rabbit is unclear, evidence suggests it was significantly larger than at present.  Habitat loss and fragmentation, agricultural land conversion, sagebrush burning, and hunting are the primary causes of this decline.  The pygmy rabbit is a candidate species for listing by the US Fish and Wildlife Service as a threatened or endangered species.  The Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit is currently on the Federal endangered species list.

Pygmy rabbits spend the majority of their lives within 30 meters of their burrows.  They depend upon sagebrush for about 98% of their winter diet, and a high portion of their spring and summer diet.  Their habitat is closely associated with dense, tall sagebrush stands.  Unlike other rabbits, pygmy rabbits dig their own burrows so they require deep, loose soils with low rock content. Other soil features that affect habitat potential include depth to saturation, flooding, ponding, and slope.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the suitability for pygmy rabbit habitat.  Soils and the associated vegetation that are rated ""high potential"" have no restrictions and provide favorable potential habitat for pygmy rabbits.  A ""moderate potential"" rating implies that the site provides moderately favorable potential habitat for pygmy rabbits.  There are some restrictive soil or plant composition features that limit the suitability of the site.  ""Low potential"" indicates that the site characteristics are such that they do not provide potential habitat for pygmy rabbits without considerable effort to artificially create sagebrush habitat outside its natural range of occurrence.  Existing plant composition should be used in combination with the ratings to help determine current habitat conditions and restoration needs based on the requirements of the wildlife species for food and cover.

The overall rating class for each soil is assigned based on the average numerical rating of the individual soil properties considered in the interpretation, some of which may not displayed.

Numerical ratings indicate the level of suitability of the soil for pygmy rabbit habitat.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01.

450,"Mechanical Treatment, Shredder",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates each soil for its suitability for a shredder mechanical treatment which is commonly practiced, sometimes in combination with seeding, for rangeland restoration.  The shredder mechanical treatment ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of shredder implements suitable for treatment of rangeland sites.  This rating should be used in conjunction with the rangeland seeding ratings or the soil restoration potential rating depending upon whether seeding or natural regeneration will be utilized on the site.

The shredder mechanical treatment is often implemented in sagebrush, mountain shrub, and pinyon-juniper vegetation types to reduce the size and composition of dense brush and trees up to 15-18 inches diameter, depending upon the equipment used.  The treatment objectives can include reducing hazardous fuel loads, increasing forage for livestock and wildlife, increased infiltration, and reduced runoff and erosion.  The equipment may also help bury seed broadcast prior to or during treatment.

There are several types of shredder equipment used for these treatments.  One of the most commonly used is a large, articulated tractor with a front-mounted, 6-8 foot wide, hydraulically controlled mower/mulcher head.  The machine has rubber, flotation-type tires which are designed for minimal ground disturbance.  The mower/mulcher head is lifted above the tree or shrub top and lowered quickly, usually completely chopping the plant in less than 15 seconds.  The rubber tired machine can also be equipped with flail shredders which use blades attached to a long, rotating horizontal shaft.  The rotating drum can be 3 to 6 feet wide by 2 feet in diameter and is often mounted on the end of a boom.  The most common type of rubber-tired shredder can safely operate on slopes up to about 20%.  Tracked vehicles are also used which can be crawler tractors or excavators equipped with a flail type or mower/shredder type attachment to shred the shrubs or trees.  Excavators have the shredder attachment mounted on a boom that can extend in any direction.  The tracked shredders can operate on slopes up to 30-35%.  Large pieces of debris can be thrown 200-300 feet during shredder operation, so safety to bystanders is an issue.

Steep slopes increase the power requirements for the equipment and limit the ability to safely perform the shredder operation.  Stones and rock outcrop make equipment operation more difficult.  High water table affects the timing of tillage by limiting access to the site.  On-site investigation is recommended before implementing any shredder mechanical treatment projects.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the suitability of soil material for the use.  'Well suited' indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for this use. Good performance can be expected. 'Moderately suited' indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable for this use. Fair performance can be expected. 'Poorly suited' indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for this use. Poor performance can be expected.

The overall rating class for each soil is assigned based on the product of the numerical ratings of the individual soil properties considered in the interpretation, some of which may not be displayed.

Numerical ratings indicate the level of suitability of the soil for shredder mechanical treatment.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01.  They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest positive impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature has the greatest negative impact (0.00).

451,Medusahead Invasion Susceptibility,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"The interpretation provides invasion susceptibility ratings and identifies the dominant soil and site characteristics that influence the susceptibility of the site to medusahead invasion.  Medusahead or medusahead wild rye (Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski) is an introduced, cool-season annual grass that is a major concern to range ecologists, wildlife biologists, and the livestock industry in the western United States.  It is an aggressive invader of disturbed or poor condition sagebrush ecological sites that can suppress desirable, native vegetation.  Medusahead is unpalatable to livestock and most wildlife species, the seeds are not digestible by upland game birds and other bird species. The long barbed awns can cause injury to the eyes, noses, and mouths of grazing animals. Medusahead can increase wildfire incidence in some dwarf sagebrush communities.  It is listed as a noxious weed in California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah.

The medusahead invasion vulnerability rating is general in nature.  It is designed to be used in the planning process to identify areas with a low resistance to invasion by medusahead.  This allows the user to plan and develop management practices that will reduce the probability of medusahead invasion.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are vulnerable to medusahead invasion due to all of the soil features that influence invasion. ""Highly susceptible"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are very favorable for invasion to occur. ""Moderately susceptible"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for invasion. ""Slightly susceptible"" indicates that the soil has features that generally make it unfavorable for invasion to occur. 

The overall rating class for each soil is assigned based on the product of the numerical ratings of the individual soil properties considered in the interpretation, some of which may not be displayed.

Numerical ratings indicate the degree of an individual soil feature's influence on invasion. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest influence on promoting medusahead invasion (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature does not promote invasion (0.00).

445,Chaining Suitability,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Chaining is commonly practiced, sometimes in combination with seeding, during rangeland restoration.  Chaining is implemented to reduce the composition of pinyon and juniper trees, mesquite, or sagebrush.  Chaining also helps bury seed broadcast prior to chaining or between two chaining operations.

Chaining is often performed with an ""Ely"" chain or other similarly modified heavy chain dragged in a loose U-shaped or J-shaped pattern between two crawler tractors.

The chaining suitability ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of implements suitable for chaining rangeland sites.  This rating should be used in conjunction with the rangeland seeding rating or the restoration opportunity rating depending upon whether seeding or natural regeneration will be utilized on the site.

Steep slopes limit the ability to safely perform the chaining operation along the contour.  Stones and rock outcrop potentially hinder the operation of the equipment.  High water table affects the timing of tillage by limiting access to the site.  On-site investigation is recommended before implementing any chaining projects.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the suitability of soil material for chaining.  ""Well suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for this use. Good performance can be expected. ""Suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are favorable for this use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance can be expected. ""Poorly suited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for this use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance can be expected.

The overall rating class for each soil is assigned based on the product of the numerical ratings of the individual soil properties considered in the interpretation, some of which may not be displayed.

Numerical ratings indicate the level of suitability of the soil for chaining.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01.  They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest positive impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature has the greatest negative impact (0.00).

446,Fencing,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Livestock fencing is the construction and maintenance of barriers for the management of livestock.  Fences are constructed using metal or wooden posts that are either treated or untreated to prevent rotting.  The posts are buried at least two feet into the soil with strands of barbed or smooth wire or mesh wire suspended between the posts.  It is desirable for livestock fence design to provide for wildlife movement.
 
This guide is used to rate the ease of setting posts, maintaining the wire tension, and estimating the replacement and maintenance cost.  Excavations for wooden posts are made by power auger or hand dug; metal posts are driven into the soil.
 
Bedrock, cemented pan, and content of coarse fragments influence the excavation of post holes and the driving of posts.  Flooding and depth to a seasonal high water table may restrict the season of construction.  Flooding also affects maintenance and replacement cost.  High water tables raise the maintenance cost and require deeper post settings.  High shrink-swell soils require deep post settings or rock jacks to maintain vertical post alignment.  Setting posts in permanently frozen soil may cause loss of the insulation qualities of the soil and result in thermokarst topography.  Post alignment and maintaining the desired wire tension are often difficult on sandy soils due to their low strength.  Soil blowing causes maintenance problems.  Frost action results in frost-heaving of the posts.  Steep slopes affect the use of power augers and the delivery of supplies.  During wet seasons, surface creep on steep slopes increases maintenance.  Soil reaction and salinity affect the type of post selected and maintenance costs.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the suitability of soil material for fences.  ""Well suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for this use. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. ""Moderately suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are favorable for this use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Poorly suited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for this use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

The overall rating class for each soil is assigned based on the average numerical rating of the individual soil properties considered in the interpretation, some of which may not displayed.

Numerical ratings indicate the level of suitability of the soil for fences.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01.  They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest positive impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature has the greatest negative impact (0.00).

447,Fire Damage Susceptibility,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Wildfire is a naturally occurring event that has helped maintain ecosystem function in wildlands.  Wildfire can be caused by natural ignition such as lightning strike, or by man-caused ignition.  Buildup of excess fuel loads can result in high severity fires that damage the soils in the burn area.  Prescribed burning is a restoration practice that is primarily designed to help return the natural fire cycle to the landscape.  Properly carried out on suitable sites, burning can be a very effective and cost efficient treatment method to help restore the desired composition of plant species in an ecological site, improve livestock access on heavy brush or slash sites, rejuvenate sprouting browse species and stagnant grass plants, release nutrients into the soil, improve palatability and nutrient content of forage, reduce fuel loading, and prepare an ash seedbed for artificial or natural seeding.  Burning may be combined with mechanical or chemical rangeland treatments.

Fuel ignition for prescribed burning can be natural or artificial using hand-held drip torches, aerial ignition, and other methods.  Fire lines can be established using natural fuel breaks, wet lines, or the removal of fuel by hand or machinery.

The susceptibility to fire damage ratings represent the relative risk of creating a water repellant layer, volatilization of essential soil nutrients, destruction of soil biological activity, and vulnerability to water and wind erosion prior to reestablishing adequate watershed cover on the burned site.  The ratings are directly related to burn severity (e.g. a low-moderate severity burn will not result in water repellant layer formation).  This rating should be used in conjunction with the rangeland seeding ratings or the soil restoration potential rating depending upon whether seeding or natural regeneration will be utilized on the site.

Sandy soils are more susceptible to formation of a water repellant layer.  High rock fragment content increases the rate of heat transfer into the soil.  Steep slopes increase the vulnerability to water erosion.  Susceptibility to formation of hydrophobic or water repellant layers varies by vegetation type.  As an example, pinyon-juniper, Arizona chaparral, and California chaparral vegetation types are more susceptible to hydrophobicity than other shrubland or grassland vegetation types.

The impacts of wildfire to soils of the burn area need to be assessed to prioritize burned area emergency rehabilitation and revegetation efforts.

Prescribed burning should be carefully planned and executed.  It should be carried out following a well designed prescription and burn plan under the supervision of a qualified prescribed burning team.  Burning objectives should be clearly defined and should be evaluated during post-burn assessments.  Minimizing risks to human health, safety, and property damage and containment of the burn are of paramount importance.

Hot, dry south-facing slopes are more susceptible to fire damage than cooler, north-facing slopes.  Fire mortality of desirable plants needs to be taken into consideration during wildfire restoration and prescribed burning planning.  On-site investigation is recommended before implementing any wildfire restoration or prescribed burning projects.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect soil damage by fire. ""Highly susceptible"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are very favorable for soil damage by fire. ""Moderately susceptible"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for damage to occur. ""Slightly susceptible"" indicates that the soil has features that generally make it unfavorable for damage to occur. 

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest impact favoring soil damage by fire (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not favorable to damage occurring (0.00).

448,Fugitive Dust Resistance,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates the vulnerability of a soil for eroded soil particles to go into suspension during a windstorm.  Fugitive dust can create extreme visibility reductions during severe windstorms creating traffic hazards and closing airports.  Power outages, expensive cleanup costs, damage to computers and communications equipment from dust, transport of potentially harmful chemicals adhering to the soil particles, and loss of soil nutrients are some of the potential effects of fugitive dust.  A positive impact is that nutrient enrichment can occur where fugitive dust is deposited.

Fugitive dust is a source of PM10 which is one of the seven air pollutants the Environmental Protection Agency regulates under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  To a lesser extent, fugitive dust is a source of PM2.5 which has proposed regulations pending under NAAQS.  PM10 and PM2.5 are defined as particulate matter with a mean diameter less than 10 microns and 2.5 microns respectively.  These soil particles are very small, can remain suspended in the air for long periods of time, and are easily inhaled into the deep lungs.  Increased risks of death and disease have been linked to periods of high outdoor PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations.  These fine particles can potentially be lifted thousands of feet into the atmosphere and transported across continents and oceans creating global health, ecological, and climate change impacts.

The soil properties and qualities that affect fugitive dust are size of surface soil particles, rock fragment content, organic matter content, calcium carbonate equivalent, aggregate stability and presence of a stable soil crust.  Clay particles have a strong propensity to form relatively large, durable soil aggregates and not contribute appreciably to fugitive dust unless these aggregates are broken down by intensive surface disturbance.  Soil moisture and the presence of frozen soil also influence fugitive dust.  Activities which break down soil aggregates and crusts increase wind erosion and production of fugitive dust.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which all of the soil features affect the formation of dust.  ""Low resistance"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the formation of dust. ""Moderate resistance"" indicates that the soil has features that are favorable for dust formation. ""High resistance"" indicates that the soil has features that are unfavorable for dust formation. 

Numerical ratings indicate the level of vulnerability of the soil for dust formation.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01.  They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature resists dust formation (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is favorable to the formation of dust (0.00).

449,"Mechanical Treatment, Rolling Drum",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates each soil for its suitability for a rolling drum mechanical treatment which is commonly practiced, sometimes in combination with seeding, for rangeland restoration.  It is implemented to reduce the size and composition of brush and young, smaller-sized trees, increase infiltration, and reduce runoff and erosion.  The equipment may also help bury seed broadcast prior to or during treatment.  The drums are often filled with water, or slurry made up of a mixture of water and soil, to increase drum weight and improve treatment effectiveness.

A rolling drum mechanical treatment is usually performed with a roller chopper, spiral-blade chopper, or land imprinter.  Roller choppers utilize a cylindrical drum, equipped with several full-length cutting blades, that is towed behind a crawler-type tractor.  Spiral-blade choppers use small blades welded to heavy drums in a staggered, spiral pattern around the drum.  Land imprinters use a heavy drum with wedges to imprint small depressions into the soil and are mainly used for seedbed preparation.

The rolling drum mechanical treatment ratings represent the relative physical limitations of soil factors upon use of rolling drum implements suitable for treatment of rangeland sites.  This rating should be used in conjunction with the rangeland seeding rating or the opportunity for restoration rating depending upon whether seeding or natural regeneration will be utilized on the site.

Steep slopes increase the power requirements for the equipment and limit the ability to safely perform the roller chopping operation.  Stones and rock outcrop damage the blades of the roller chopper and make towing more difficult.  High clay content reduces effectiveness of the treatment.  High water table affects the timing of tillage by limiting access to the site.  On-site investigation is recommended before implementing any rolling drum mechanical treatment projects.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are made suitable by all of the soil features that affect the suitability of soil material for the use.  'Well suited' indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for this use. Good performance can be expected. 'Moderately suited' indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable for this use. Fair performance can be expected. 'Poorly suited' indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for this use. Poor performance can be expected.

524,"Nitrate Leaching Potential, Irrigated (WA)",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation is designed to evaluate the potential for nitrate-nitrogen to be transmitted through the soil profile below the root zone by percolating water under irrigated conditions. Leaching nitrates have the potential to contaminate shallow and deep aquifers used for drinking water. The ratings are based on inherent soil and climate properties that affect nitrate leaching and do not account for management practices, such as crop rotation, rates and timing of nitrogen fertilizer applications, and management of irrigation water.

The following soil and climate factors are used in the interpretation criteria:

1. Mean annual precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration.-This factor provides an estimate of the amount of water that is available to move through the soil profile on an annual basis from precipitation. Potential evaporation is estimated from mean annual air temperature using an algorithm (developed by the National Soil Survey Center) that employs the Hamon potential evapotranspiration method. 

2. Water travel time through the entire soil profile.-This factor uses the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and thickness of each soil horizon to estimate the number of hours that would be required for a given volume of water to move through the entire soil profile. One advantage of this method for estimating the rate of water movement is that the properties and thickness of each soil horizon are accounted for instead of using an average saturated hydraulic conductivity for the entire profile. This method accounts for subtle differences between soils in texture, structure, horizon thickness, and depth to water-restricting layers. 

3. Available water capacity.-Tthis factor accounts for the cumulative amount of water available to plants that the entire soil profile can hold at field capacity to a depth of 150 cm. The more water the soil profile can hold, the less water is available for deep leaching.

4. Depth to and duration of a water table.-This factor uses a water table index based on the minimum average depth to a water table and the number of months that the water table is present during the period from April through October. The factor is used to account for the loss of nitrates to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide or nitrogen gas due to denitrification under anaerobic conditions caused by water saturation. The higher the water table and the longer its duration, the larger the quantity of nitrates that would potentially be lost to the atmosphere and therefore would not be available for deep leaching.

5. Slope gradient adjusted for hydrologic soil group.-The steeper the slope gradient, the higher the potential for surface runoff and the lower the amount of water available to move through the soil profile. The following adjustments are made to the slope gradient by hydrologic group to account for differences in potential for surface runoff:

Hydrologic group A-slope % x 0.75
Hydrologic group B-slope % x 0.85
Hydrologic group C-slope % x 0.95
Hydrologic group D-no adjustment


The ratings are both verbal and numerical. The ratings for Nitrate Leaching Potential, Irrigated Areas, are calculated as follows:


1. The Water Travel Time subrule is weighted by multiplying by 0.60. 
2. The Available Water Capacity subrule is weighted by multiplying by 0.40. 
3. The sum of these two weighted subrules results in a value between 0.00 and 1.00.
4. Adjustments are then made for water table depth and duration and for slope gradient adjusted for hydrologic group. The sum of the values from these subrules is subtracted from the sum in step 3 above. The maximum reduction is 0.50 for the water table index subrule and 0.30 for the slope gradient subrule.
5. A final positive adjustment is made for the Mean Annual Precipitation minus Potential Evapotranspiration subrule. The maximum addition is 0.60.

The ratings for Nitrate Leaching Potential, Nonirrigated Areas, are calculated with different weighting factors from those listed for the irrigated interpretation.

The following rating classes for Nitrate Leaching Potential, Irrigated Areas, are assigned based on the final calculation from the factors above:

Low: 0.00 to 0.25
Moderate: 0.26 to 0.50
Moderately high: 0.51 to 0.75
High: 0.76 to 1.00

The ratings indicate the potential for nitrate leaching below the root zone, based on inherent soil and climate properties and application of irrigation water. A ""low"" rating indicates a low potential for leaching of nitrates below the root zone. A ""high"" rating indicates a high potential for leaching of nitrates below the root zone. The ""moderate"" and ""moderately high"" ratings indicate intermediate potential.

Evaluations consider movement of water through the soil and underlying fractured bedrock. Ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. The properties that affect the pesticide loss potential include the soil's hydrologic group, depth to water table, saturated hydraulic conductivity at different depths, and the possibility of water movement in fractured bedrock.
The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that have low leaching potential. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately rated for leaching potential. Some leaching can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable and leaching potential is high.
Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.

637,Western Juniper Encroachment Potential (OR),cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation evaluates the potential for western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) to encroach into plant communities in which it did not exist historically or the potential for it to increase beyond its historic composition within a plant community. For the purpose of this interpretation, encroachment potential is defined as the probability of a western juniper seed on a site producing a self-sustaining plant.

The intent of this interpretation is to identify areas that are susceptible to encroachment by western juniper, not to identify areas where western juniper currently does or does not exist. In addition, it is important to recognize the difference between the rate of encroachment and the potential for encroachment. Some soil map unit components may be susceptible to encroachment, but the rate of encroachment may be very slow. This interpretation focuses only on the factors that influence seedling establishment, not on the factors that influence the rate at which they establish (rate of expansion).

The ratings for western juniper encroachment potential are based on the following features:

1.  Soil chemistry - sodium adsorption ratio and electrical conductivity
2.  Soil climate - taxonomic temperature regime and mean annual precipitation
3.  Depth to root-restricting feature, such as bedrock or cemented pan
4.  Content of clay in the surface layer and depth to abrupt textural change (material that is high in content of clay)
5.  Content of rock fragments in the surface layer
6.  Drainage class
7.  Landform
8.  Major land resource area (MLRA) in which the map unit occurs
9.  Ecological site

The ecological site criterion is used to identify soil map unit components that are associated with old growth western juniper plant communities, which do not have the potential for western juniper encroachment. These components are assigned the rating class, ""Old growth - no encroachment potential.""

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.00 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a feature results in the greatest risk of western juniper encroachment (1.00) and the point at which the feature does not contribute to a risk of western juniper encroachment (0.00).

Biosolids are the nutrient-rich organic byproduct obtained from municipal wastewater treatment.   Biosolids can be solid, liquid, or semisolid.  Animal manures, food processing byproducts, and other organic materials are not considered biosolids, and are not addressed here.

To be called biosolids, raw solids must be processed to meet U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards.  Raw solids are processed by digestion, composting, or other technologies at the wastewater treatment facility.  Trace element concentrations in biosolids must be lower than EPA standards for arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc.    Biosolids must also meet EPA standards for human pathogen reduction and organic matter stabilization. 

This interpretation evaluates each soils limitations as a location for land application of such biosolids.  The soil properties used for evaluating the soil in spring months are as follows. The interpretation evaluates flooding, ponding and depth to saturated zone data for the months of June through September.

78,Disposal of Wastewater by Irrigation,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Wastewater includes municipal and food-processing wastewater and effluent from lagoons or storage ponds. Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality. It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste. It may have received primary or secondary treatment. It is rarely untreated sewage. Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption. In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride. The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste. Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter. The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste. The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter. When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

Disposal of wastewater by irrigation not only disposes of municipal wastewater and wastewater from food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds but also can improve crop production by increasing the amount of water available to crops. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the design, construction, management, and performance of the irrigation system. The properties that affect design and management include the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a water table, ponding, available water capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), slope, and flooding. The properties that affect construction include stones, cobbles, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, and ponding. The properties that affect performance include depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, bulk density, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, reaction, and the cation-exchange capacity, which is used to estimate the capacity of a soil to adsorb heavy metals. Permanently frozen soils are not suitable for disposal of wastewater by irrigation.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect agricultural waste management. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

57,Disposal of Wastewater by Rapid Infiltration,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Rapid infiltration of wastewater is a process in which wastewater applied in a level basin at a rate of 4 to 120 inches per week percolates through the soil. The wastewater may eventually reach the ground water. The application rate commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland. Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment; thus, the basins may or may not be vegetated. The thickness of the soil material needed for proper treatment of the wastewater is more than 72 inches. As a result, geologic and hydrologic investigation is needed to ensure proper design and performance and to determine the risk of ground-water pollution.

Soil properties are important considerations in areas where soils are used as sites for the treatment and disposal of organic waste and wastewater. Selection of soils with properties that favor waste management can help to prevent environmental damage.

Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality. It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste. It may have received primary or secondary treatment. It is rarely untreated sewage. Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption. In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride. The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste. Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter. The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste. The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter. When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the risk of pollution and the design, construction, and performance of the system. Depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan affect the risk of pollution and the design and construction of the system. Slope, stones, and cobbles also affect design and construction. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and reaction affect performance. Permanently frozen soils are unsuitable for waste treatment.

The length of the run generally is 150 to 300 feet. The application rate ranges from 2.5 to 16.0 inches per week. It commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland. The wastewater leaves solids and nutrients on the vegetated surfaces as it flows downslope in a thin film. Most of the water reaches the collection ditch, some is lost through evapotranspiration, and a small amount may percolate to the ground water.

512,"Land Application of Municipal Biosolids, winter, (OR)",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Municipal biosolids are one class of organic byproduct that can successfully be recycled via land application.  Biosolids are the nutrient-rich organic byproduct obtained from municipal wastewater treatment.   Biosolids can be solid, liquid, or semisolid.  Animal manures, food processing byproducts, and other organic materials are not considered biosolids, and are not addressed here.

To be called biosolids, raw solids must be processed to meet U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards.  Raw solids are processed by digestion, composting, or other technologies at the wastewater treatment facility.  Trace element concentrations in biosolids must be lower than EPA standards for arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc.    Biosolids must also meet EPA standards for human pathogen reduction and organic matter stabilization. 

This interpretation evaluates each soils limitations as a location for land application of such biosolids.  The soil properties used for evaluating the soil in winter months are as follows. The interpretation evaluates flooding, ponding and depth to saturated zone data for the months of October through April.
    
From map unit data (no seasonal adjustment) the following properties are considered:
    - Cobble content
    - Salinity
    - Depth to bedrock
    - Depth to cemented pan
    - Shallow to densic materials
    - Slope
    - Sodium content
    - Large stones on surface
    - Depth to Permafrost
    - Shallow to contrasting materials (discontinuity)
    - Poor filtering capacity (coarse materials)
    - Slow percolation/permeability

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect agricultural waste management. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

389,"Irrigation, Sprinkler (Close Spaced Drops)",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation evaluates a soil's limitation(s) for installation and use of sprinkler irrigation systems equipped with low pressure spray nozzles mounted on closely spaced drops that apply water close to the ground surface.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

These systems are generally found on linear move or center pivot systems, and they have separate slope criteria from other sprinkler systems because of their higher application rates, which increase risk of runoff and irrigation-induced erosion on steeper slopes.  Examples of these types of systems include Low Pressure in Canopy (LPIC), Low Energy Precision Application (LEPA), Low Elevation Spray Application (LESA), and Mid-Elevation Spray Application (MESA) systems. These types of irrigation systems are generally suitable for small grains, row crops, and vegetables.  

The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems utilizing close spaced spray nozzles on drops are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, surface coarse fragments, saturated hydraulic conductivity, salinity, slope, wetness, and flooding. The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are surface texture, surface rocks, salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, wetness, erosion potential, and available water holding capacity.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the interpretation. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by the soil features that affect the soil interpretation.  Verbal soil rating classes are based on the highest numerical rating for the most limiting soil feature(s) considered in the rating process.  ""Not limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature = 0.00) indicates that the soil has no limiting features for the specified use.  ""Somewhat limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature =.01 to .99) indicates that the soil has limiting features for the specified use that can be overcome with proper planning, design, installation, and management.  The effort required to overcome a soil limitation increases as the numerical rating increases.  ""Very limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature = 1.00) indicates that the soil has one or more very limiting features that can only be overcome with special planning, major soil modification, special design, or significant management practices.

Lesser soil restrictive features have a lower numerical value than the maximum used to rate the soil, and they are identified to provide the user with additional information about soil limitations for the specific use.  Lesser soil restrictive features also need to be considered in planning, design, installation, and management.

The properties that affect the surface system performance include depth to bedrock, saturated hydraulic conductivity, depth to cemented pan, slope, flooding, ponding, large stone content, sodicity, surface water erosion, and gypsum content.
The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. 

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as that listed for the map unit.  The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is given so that the user will realize the percentage of each map unit that has the specified rating.  

A map unit may have other components with different ratings.  The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart site. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site.",,,Interpretation,"WMS - Surface Water Management, System",1,,0,1,0,0,,0,,,1,swmSystem,,,,,,,,0,,NA,NA,Centimeters,0,,,Weighted Average,0,0,,1,5,NA,"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""5""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Very limited"" label=""Very limited"" order=""1""><Color red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Somewhat limited"" label=""Somewhat limited"" order=""2""><Color red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Not limited"" label=""Not limited"" order=""3""><Color red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>",1,06/06/2014 10:43:17,Dominant Condition,NA,1,String
471,Soil Taxonomy Classification,component,taxclname,String,120,NA,"This rating presents the taxonomic classification based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the classification of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

191,Conservation Tree and Shrub Group,component,constreeshrubgrp,Choice,254,NA,"Each tree and shrub species has certain climatic and physiographic limits. Within these parameters, trees and shrubs may be well suited or poorly suited to a given environment because of climate or site or soil characteristics. On the basis of the performance of individual species to specific conditions of soil, climate, physiography, and management, Conservation Tree and Shrub Groups (CTSGs) have been developed. Individual soils have been grouped with similar soils into one of the 10 main CTSGs. Most of these main groups are further divided into subgroups.

This interpretation provides guidance in selecting the species best suited to each of the groups of soils within each vegetative zone. It also can be used for predicting survival, height, growth, species attributes, and effectiveness and for selecting species for windbreaks, riparian plantings, recreation and wildlife plantings, and ornamental or environmental plantings.

Tree and shrub species associated with each CTSG are broken down by vegetative zones (rainfall zones). These lists are available in the local office of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, or on the Web in the electronic Field Office Technical Guide. Because vegetative zones are rather large, climatic differences within a zone should be considered when species are recommended for planting. For example, some species adapted to the eastern end of a zone may be inadequately adapted to the western end. Care must be taken to ensure that conditions on individual sites are considered when species suitability and performance are determined. A case-by-case decision may be necessary to determine which CTSG is most appropriate when an individual site has characteristics that differ from those of the CTSG in which it occurs. These differences occur because of inclusions of other soils, site modifications (such as leveling and drainage manipulation), soil pH (calcareous sites), irrigation, soil amendments, or other factors.",,,Property,,NA,,0,1,0,0,,0,,,-1,ConsTSG,,,,,,,,0,,NA,NA,,0,,,Weighted Average,0,0,,1,7,NA,"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""7"">

523,NH Forest Soil Group,mapunit,nhiforsoigrp,Choice,254,NA,"NH Forest Soil Groups (NHFSGs) consist of map units that are similar in their potential for commercial forest products, their suitability for native tree growth, and their use and management. Considered in grouping the map units are depth to bedrock, texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, available water capacity, drainage class, and slope. The grouping applies only to soils in the State of New Hampshire.

The NHFSGs have been developed to help land users and managers in New Hampshire evaluate the relative productivity of soils and to better understand patterns of plant succession and how soil and site interactions influence management decisions. The soils are assigned to one of five groups (IA, IB, IC, IIA, and IIB). Several map units in New Hampshire either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG (NC). Examples of NC map units are very poorly drained soils and soils at high elevations. The kinds of tree species generally growing in climax stands in each of the five NHFSGs vary from county to county. This information is available through local NRCS field offices. 


IA--This group consists of very deep, loamy, moderately well drained or well drained soils. Generally, these soils are more fertile than other soils and have the most favorable soil moisture relationships. 

IB--The soils in this group are generally sandy or loamy over sandy material and are slightly less fertile than group IA soils.  Group IB soils are moderately well drained or well drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good tree growth, but it may not be quite as abundant as that in group IA soils. 

IC--The soils in this group are in areas of outwash sand and gravel. They are moderately well to excessively drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good softwood growth but is limited for hardwoods. 

IIA--This diverse group includes many of the same soils as those in groups IA and IB. The soils are separated into a unique group, however, because they have physical limitations that make forest management more difficult and costly, i.e., steep slopes, bedrock outcrops, erosive textures, surface boulders, and extreme rockiness. 

IIB--The soils in this group are poorly drained. The seasonal high water table is generally within 12 inches of the surface. Productivity is generally less than that of soils in the other groups. 

NC--The map units in this category either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG. Commonly, onsite visit would be required to evaluate the situation.",,,Property,,NA,,1,0,0,0,,0,,,-1,NHFsg,,,,,,,,0,,NA,NA,Centimeters,0,,,Weighted Average,0,0,,1,2,NA,"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Group IA"" label=""Group IA"" order=""1""><Color red=""0"" green=""176"" blue=""80"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IB"" label=""Group IB"" order=""2""><Color red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IC"" label=""Group IC"" order=""3""><Color red=""255"" green=""102"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IIA"" label=""Group IIA"" order=""4""><Color red=""153"" green=""102"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IIB"" label=""Group IIB"" order=""5""><Color red=""255"" green=""204"" blue=""102"" /></Labels><Labels value=""NC"" label=""NC"" order=""6""><Color red=""255"" green=""175"" blue=""234"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>",1,11/03/2011 10:24:20,No Aggregation Necessary,NA,1,Choice
16,Hydric Rating by Map Unit,component,hydricrating,Choice,254,NA,"This rating indicates the percentage of map units that meets the criteria for hydric soils. Map units are composed of one or more map unit components or soil types, each of which is rated as hydric soil or not hydric. Map units that are made up dominantly of hydric soils may have small areas of minor nonhydric components in the higher positions on the landform, and map units that are made up dominantly of nonhydric soils may have small areas of minor hydric components in the lower positions on the landform. Each map unit is rated based on its respective components and the percentage of each component within the map unit. 

The thematic map is color coded based on the composition of hydric components. The five color classes are separated as 100 percent hydric components, 66 to 99 percent hydric components, 33 to 65 percent hydric components, 1 to 32 percent hydric components, and less than one percent hydric components.

In Web Soil Survey, the Summary by Map Unit table that is displayed below the map pane contains a column named 'Rating'.  In this column the percentage of each map unit that is classified as hydric is displayed.

Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994). Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation. 

The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with wetness. In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration of the water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002). These criteria are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands. The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in ""Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and ""Keys to Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) and in the ""Soil Survey Manual"" (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). 

If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field. These visible properties are indicators of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite determinations of hydric soils are specified in ""Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States"" (Hurt and Vasilas, 2006).

2685,National Commodity Crop Productivity Index v3,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,3,"National Commodity Crop Productivity Index is a method of arraying the soils of the United States for non-irrigated commodity crop production based on their inherent soil properties.  The rating a soil is assigned is the highest one of four basic crop group indices, which are based on the climate where the crop is typically grown.  Cooler climates are represented by winter wheat, moderate climates are represented by corn and soybeans, and warmer climates are represented by cotton.  (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_050734.pdf)

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  Soil, site, and climate properties that influence the growth of crops are major considerations. Soil productivity is influenced by many soil properties.  An ideal soil will store adequate amounts of water to nurture the crop between rains.  This soil will have a near-neutral pH, will store nutrients, and lack toxic materials.  The soil will have no barriers, either physical or chemical, to root growth.  Water and gas transmission through the soil will be sufficient to maintain both water and oxygen at sufficient levels in the root zone.   The soil will not be saturated with water during the growing season to the point that root growth is inhibited.  The soil will not be subject to excessive flooding or ponding during the growing season.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects erosion by water, runoff, and the operation of equipment.  The climate must provide adequate water and heat to allow the desired crop to mature.  A soil that differs from the ideal in any of these features will have lower inherent productivity for a particular crop.  The further a soil differs from ideality in any one or all of the factors that determine inherent productivity, the lower its inherent productivity will be. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the estimated productivity which is determined by all of the soil, site, and climatic features that affect crop productivity. ""High inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil, site, and climate have features that are very favorable for crop production. High yields and low risk of crop failure can be expected if a high level of management is employed. ""Moderately high inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally quite favorable for crop production.  Good yields and moderately low risk of crop failure can be expected. ""Moderate inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable for crop production.  Good yields and moderate risk of crop failure can be expected.  ""Moderately low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally not favorable for crop production.  Low yields and moderately high risk of crop failure can be expected.   ""Low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for crop production.  Low yields and high risk of crop failure can be expected.  

Numerical ratings indicate the overall productivity of the soil. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01. They indicate gradations between the point at which the combination of soil, site, and climate features has the greatest positive impact on inherent productivity (1.00) and the point at which the soil features are very unfavorable (0.01). 

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.

It is defined as the numerical difference between the liquid limit and plastic limit of the soil.  It is the range of water content in which a soil exhibits the characteristics of a plastic solid. 

The plastic limit is the water content that corresponds to an arbitrary limit between the plastic and semisolid states of a soil.  The liquid limit is the water content, on a percent by weight basis, of the soil (passing #40 sieve) at which the soil changes from a plastic to a liquid state.   

Soils that have a high plasticity index have a wide range of moisture content in which the soil performs as a plastic material. Highly and moderately plastic clays have large PI values.  Plasticity index is used in classifying soils in the Unified and AASHTO classification systems.

101,Available Water Storage,chorizon,awc_r,Float,NA,2,"Available water storage (AWS) is the total volume of water (in centimeters) that should be available to plants when the soil, inclusive of rock fragments, is at field capacity. It is commonly estimated as the amount of water held between field capacity and the wilting point, with corrections for salinity, rock fragments, and rooting depth. AWS is reported as a single value (in centimeters) of water for the specified depth of the soil. AWS is calculated as the available water capacity times the thickness of each soil horizon to a specified depth.

For each soil layer, available water capacity, used in the computation of AWS, is recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For the derivation of AWS, only the representative value for available water capacity is used.

The available water storage for each map unit component is computed as described above and then aggregated to a single value for the map unit by the process described below.

A map unit typically consists of one or more ""components."" A component is either some type of soil or some nonsoil entity, e.g., rock outcrop. For the attribute being aggregated (e.g., available water storage), the first step of the aggregation process is to derive one attribute value for each of a map unit's components. From this set of component attributes, the next step of the process is to derive a single value that represents the map unit as a whole. Once a single value for each map unit is derived, a thematic map for the map units can be generated. Aggregation is needed because map units rather than components are delineated on the soil maps.

The composition of each component in a map unit is recorded as a percentage. A composition of 60 indicates that the component typically makes up approximately 60 percent of the map unit.

For the available water storage, when a weighted average of all component values is computed, percent composition is the weighting factor. ",centimeters,cm,Property,,NA,,0,1,0,1,,1,,,1,AWS,,,,,,,,1,Depth Range,NA,NA,,0,,,Weighted Sum,0,0,,0,3,5,"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""3"">

Temperature, texture, density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), content of organic matter, and depth to the water table are the most important factors considered in evaluating the potential for frost action. It is assumed that the soil is not insulated by vegetation or snow and is not artificially drained. Silty and highly structured, clayey soils that have a high water table in winter are the most susceptible to frost action. Well drained, very gravelly, or very sandy soils are the least susceptible.

Group A. Soils having a high infiltration rate (low runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist mainly of deep, well drained to excessively drained sands or gravelly sands. These soils have a high rate of water transmission.

Group B. Soils having a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that have moderately fine texture to moderately coarse texture. These soils have a moderate rate of water transmission.

Group C. Soils having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of soils having a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or soils of moderately fine texture or fine texture. These soils have a slow rate of water transmission.

Group D. Soils having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential, soils that have a high water table, soils that have a claypan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material.

113,"Vehicle Trafficability, Type 1, Dry Season",cointerp,interphrc,string,254,NA,"Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight and have low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch). For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during dry periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (one) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).",,,Interpretation,MIL - Trafficability Veh.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils when wet is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands).

126,"Vehicle Trafficability, Type 6, 1 Pass, Wet Season",cointerp,interphrc,string,254,NA,"Military category type 6 vehicles are a great number of all-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles intended primarily for highway use. For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during wet periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils when wet is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for one vehicle pass. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

Ratings are based on the soil properties that influence construction, maintenance, and readiness of the landing zones. A dusty surface layer, slope, and the content of large stones influence the development and functionality of the landing zone. Flooding or ponding may restrict the period when the landing zone can be used.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect helicopter landing zones. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during wet periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils when wet is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for one vehicle pass. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected.

106,Bivouac Areas,cointerp,interphrc,string,254,NA,"Bivouac areas are used intensively as field operation centers for military activity. They commonly require site preparation, such as shaping and leveling in areas used for tents and in parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines. Bivouac areas are subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

This interpretation identifies those soil properties that influence the ease of developing bivouac areas and the performance of the areas after development. Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use also are important. The limitations are less restrictive on sites for tents or remote camps.

Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan are the main concerns in developing bivouac areas. For good trafficability, the surface of the bivouac area should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and large stones. The limitations of low Ksat and a clayey surface layer are not so severe in dry regions of the country as in other regions; however, silty soils may be more of a problem in the dry regions because they are dusty. Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and the presence of toxic materials. Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous as bivouac areas because of the danger to life and property.

232,"Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"""Catastrophic mortality, large animal disposal, pit,"" is a method of disposing of dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated pit. The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit. When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected. Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater. The risk of contamination can be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of limiting soil properties. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet). However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water and to determine the design needed. These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources. The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata at or directly below the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations. Soils that are flooded or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate. Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit. It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits in which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour of the land.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final cover is based largely on soil texture and consistence, which determine workability when the soil is dry and when it is wet. Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses. The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that favors the growth of plants. It should not contain excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid. In comparison with other horizons, the surface layer in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter. Thus, it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

233,"Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"""Catastrophic mortality, large animal disposal, trench,"" is a method of disposing of dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated trench. The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the trench. When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the filled trench area.

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected. Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater. The risk of contamination can be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of limiting soil properties. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet). Because trenches may be as deep as 15 feet or more, however, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water and to determine the design needed. These investigations, which are generally arranged by the trench developer, include examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources. The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata at or directly below the proposed trench bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.

275,"Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-Scale Event",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Burial of rubble and debris in an expeditiously constructed landfill is a method of disposing of material that has been rendered unsafe and unusable by the effects of a large-scale disaster, either natural or man-made, often affecting tens of counties or parishes.  Many homes and business structures are rendered unfit for occupancy, either by destruction or contamination.  Such a landfill involves excavating a large pit or trench, placing the rubble and debris in the trench, and covering each layer with a blanket of soil material.  A final blanket of cover material is placed over the whole facility when completed.

This interpretation shows the degree and kind of limitations that affect a soil's use for such a landfill. The soil is evaluated from the surface to 79 inches.  An on-site investigation to greater depth will be needed for final site acceptance.  The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect attenuation of suspended, soil solution, and gaseous decomposition products and microorganisms; construction and maintenance of the site; and public health.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Soils that have high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) or are shallow to bedrock, ice, a cemented pan, or stones and boulders are limited because these features interfere with the installation, performance, and maintenance of the system.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the excavation.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench or pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the ground contour.

2647,Soil Health - Organic Matter,chorizon,om_r,Float,NA,2,"Organic matter percent is the weight of decomposed plant, animal, and microbial residues exclusive of non-decomposed plant and animal residues. It is expressed as a percentage, by weight, of the soil material that is less than 2 mm in diameter.

Significance:
Soil organic matter (SOM) influences the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils far more than suggested by its relatively small proportion in most soils. The organic fraction influences plant growth through its influence on these soil properties. It encourages soil aggregation, especially macroaggregation, increases porosity, and lowers bulk density. Because the soil structure is improved, water infiltration rates increase. SOM has a high capacity to adsorb and exchange cations and is important to pesticide binding. It furnishes energy to microorganisms in the soil. As SOM is decomposed by soil microbes, it releases nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, and many micronutrients, which become available for plant growth. SOM is a heterogeneous, dynamic substance that varies in particle size, carbon content, decomposition rate, and turnover time. In general, the content of SOM is highest at the surface—where plant, animal, and microbial residue inputs are greatest—and decreases with depth. 

Total organic carbon (TOC) is the carbon (C) stored in SOM. Total organic carbon is also referred to as soil organic carbon (SOC) in the scientific literature. Organic carbon enters the soil through the decomposition of plant and animal residues, root exudates, and living and dead microorganisms. Inorganic carbon is common in calcareous soils in the form of calcium and magnesium carbonates. In calcareous soils, the content of inorganic carbon can exceed TOC.

Factors Affecting Content of SOM and SOC:

Inherent factors - Soil texture, parent material, drainage, climate, and time affect accumulation of SOM. Soils that are rich in clay have greater capacity to protect SOM from decomposition by stabilizing substances that bind to clay surfaces. The formation of soil aggregates—enabled by the presence of clay, aluminum and iron oxides, fungal hyphae, bacterial exudates (carbohydrates), and fine roots—protects SOM from microbial decomposition. Extractable aluminum and allophanes, which are present in volcanic soils, can react with SOM to form compounds that are stable and resist microbial decomposition. Warm temperatures increase decomposition rates of SOM. High mean annual precipitation increases accumulation rates of SOM by stimulating the production of plant biomass. 

Loss of SOM through erosion results in SOM variations along slope gradients. Areas of level topography tend to have much more SOM than areas with other slope classes. Both elevation and topographic gradients affect local climate, vegetation distribution, and soil properties. They also affect associated biogeochemical processes, including SOM dynamics. Analysis of factors affecting C in the conterminous United States indicates that the effects of land use, topography (elevation and slope), and mean annual precipitation on SOM are more obvious than the effects of mean annual temperature. However, when other variables are highly restricted, SOM content clearly declines with increasing temperature.

Dynamic factors - Dynamic gains and losses in SOM are due primarily to management decisions in combination with climate and microbial influences. Accumulation of SOM is controlled by the rate of C mineralization, the amount and stage of decomposition of plant residues, and the addition of organic amendments to soil.

Soil organic carbon comprises approximately 52 to 58% of the SOM and is the main source of energy for soil microorganisms. The C within plant residues, particulate organic matter, and soil microbial biomass is generally considered to be within the active pool of SOM. The emergent view of SOM focuses on microbial access to SOM and includes an emphasis on the need to manage C flows rather than discrete C pools. During decomposition of SOM, energy and nutrients are released and utilized by plant roots and soil biota. Recognizing that SOM is a continuum of decomposition products is a first step in designing management strategies for renewing SOM sources throughout the year.

Soil aggregates of various sizes and stabilities can act as sites at which SOM is physically protected from decomposition and C mineralization. Soil disturbance and aggregate destruction increase biodegradation of SOM. Aggregates are readily broken apart by tillage operations.

Crop residues incorporated into or left on the soil surface reduce erosion and the losses of SOM associated with sediment. In acidic soils, applications of lime increase plant productivity, microbial activity, organic matter decomposition, and CO2 release.

The diversity of the soil microbial population affects SOM. For example, while soil bacteria and some fungi participate in SOM loss by mineralizing C compounds, other fungi, such as mycorrhizae, facilitate stabilization and physical protection by aggregating SOM with clay and minerals. SOM is better protected from degradation within aggregates than in free-form. 

Relationship to Soil Function:
SOM is one of the most important soil constituents. It affects plant growth by improving aggregate stability, soil structure, water availability, and nutrient cycling. SOM fractions in the active pool, described above, are the main source of energy and nutrients for soil microorganisms, which mediate nutrient cycling in the soil. Biochemically stable SOM participates in aggregate stability and in holding capacity for nutrients and water.

Microaggregates are formed by mineral interactions with iron and aluminum oxides and are generally considered an inherent soil characteristic. They are, however, impacted by current and past management. Fine roots, fungal hyphae, and organic carbon compounds, such as complex sugars (carbohydrates) and proteins (also referred to as glues), bind mineral particles and microaggregates together to form macroaggregates that are still porous enough to allow air, water, and plant roots to move through the soil.

An increase in SOM leads to greater biological diversity and activity in the soil, thus increasing biological control of plant diseases and pests.

Problems Associated with Low Organic Matter Levels:
Low levels of SOM result in energy-source shortages and thereby lowered levels of microbial biomass, activity, and nutrient mineralization. In noncalcareous soils, aggregate stability, infiltration, drainage, and airflow are also reduced. Scarcity of SOM results in less diversity in soil biota and a risk of disruption to the food chain equilibrium. This disruption can cause disturbance in the soil environment (e.g., increased plant pests and diseases and accumulation of toxic substances).

Improving SOM Levels:
An estimated 4.4x10 to the 9th power tons of C have been lost from soils of the United States due to traditional farming practices. Most of this carbon was SOC. Nearly half of the SOM has been lost from many agricultural soils. Other farming practices, such as no-till and cover cropping (especially when used together), can stop losses of SOM and even lead to increases. Continuous application of manure and compost can increase SOM. Burning, harvesting, or otherwise removing plant residues decreases SOM.

Measurement:
SOM is measured in the laboratory by determining total carbon (TC) content using either dry or wet-dry combustion. Current analytical methods do not distinguish between decomposed and nondecomposed residues, so soil is first sieved to 2 mm to remove as much of the recognizable plant material as possible. If no carbonates are present, TC is considered to be the same as TOC (or SOC). For calcareous soils, soil inorganic carbon in the form carbonates must also be measured and then subtracted from the TC to determine TOC content. Results are given as the percent TOC in dry soil. To convert percent TOC to percent SOM, multiply the TOC percentage by 1.724. To convert percent SOM to percent TOC, divide the SOM percentage by 1.724. Note that this value continues to be debated by researchers with possible values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 (Pribyl, 2010). A conversion factor of 2 has been suggested for this database but has not yet been adopted. Detailed procedures for measurement of SOM are outlined in 'Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version 5.0,' (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

Many soil testing laboratories use a 'loss on ignition' method to estimate soil organic matter. The estimate produced by this method must be correlated to analytical TOC measurements for each area to improve accuracy. The loss on ignition method can provide a good indication of the trend in SOM content within a field. It is important to note that temperature and timing used for the loss on ignition approach vary across labs and can influence results. Thus, comparisons should be made using only results from within a given lab.

Currently, no standard method exists to measure TOC in the field. Attempts have been made to develop charts that match color to TOC content, but the correlation is better within soil landscapes and only for limited soils. Near-infrared spectroscopy has been tested for measuring C directly in the field, but it is expensive and sensitive to moisture content.

Estimates:
Color and feel are soil characteristics that can be used to estimate SOM content. Color comparisons in areas of similar parent materials and textures can be correlated with laboratory data and thereby enable a soil scientist to make field estimates. In general, darker colors or black indicate the presence of higher amounts of organic matter. The contrast of color between the A horizon and subsurface horizons is also a good indicator. Sandy soils tend to look darker with a lower content of SOM. In general, lower numbers for hue, value, and chroma (in the Munsell soil color system) tend to be associated with darker soil colors that are attributed to higher content of SOM, soil moisture, or both.

For each soil layer, this attribute is actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A 'representative' value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For this soil property, only the representative value is used.

2682,Fragile Soil Index,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Soils can be rated based on their susceptibility to degradation in the ""Fragile Soil Index"" interpretation.  Fragile soils are those that are most vulnerable to degradation. In other words, they can be easily degraded—they have a low resistance to degradation processes. They tend to be highly susceptible to erosion and can have a low capacity to recover after degradation has occurred (low resilience). Fragile soils are generally characterized by a low content of organic matter, low aggregate stability, and weak soil structure. They are generally located on sloping ground, have sparse plant cover, and tend to be in arid or semiarid regions. The index can be used for conservation and watershed planning to assist in identifying soils and areas highly vulnerable to degradation.

Depending on inherent soil characteristics and the climate, soils can vary from highly resistant, or stable, to vulnerable and extremely sensitive to degradation. Under stress, fragile soils can degrade to a new altered state, which may be less favorable or unfavorable for plant growth and less capable of performing soil functions. To assess the fragility of the soil, indicators of vulnerability to degradation processes are used. They include organic matter, soil structure, rooting depth, vegetative cover, slope, and aridity. 

The organic matter content indicates the capacity of the soil to resist and/or recover from degradation processes. Organic matter improves the soil pore structure, increases water infiltration, and reduces soil compaction and soil erosion. Soil structure indicates the capacity of the soil to resist degradation from accelerated water erosion (by increasing the amount of infiltration). Pore structure is the most important aspect of soil structure as pores provide habitat for organism. Shallow soils are more vulnerable to degradation processes because they have limited rooting depth and have a reduced amount of material from which to form new soil. As erosion removes the upper soil profile, productivity will decline if the subsoil is limiting for crop growth. Vegetative cover is very important as uncovered soil is most vulnerable to the processes of soil erosion, both by wind and water. Slope (a measure of the steepness or the degree of inclination) indicates the degree of vulnerability to erosion and mass movement. Aridity is defined by the shortage of moisture. Lack of water is a main factor limiting biological processes and the ability of the soil to resist and/or recover from degradation.

Soils are placed into interpretive classes based on their index rating, which ranges from 0 to 1. An index rating of 1 is the most fragile, while a rating of zero is the least fragile. Interpretative classes are as follows:

Not Fragile (index rating less than or equal to 0.009) – These soils have a very high potential to resist degradation and be highly resilient. They are highly structured with an organic matter content greater than 5.7%, are nearly level, are deep or very deep, have greater than 85% vegetative cover, and are in a climate that is wet or very wet.

Slightly Fragile (index rating less than 0.009 and less than or equal to 0.209) – These soils have a high potential to resist degradation and be resilient. They are:
-- Poorly structured to weakly structured soils that have an extremely low to moderate content of organic matter, are very deep, have high vegetative cover, occur on nearly level ground, and are in wet or very wet climates;
-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very shallow to moderately deep, have high vegetative cover, occur on nearly level ground, and are in wet or very wet climates;
-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very deep, have low to moderately high vegetative cover, occur on nearly level ground, and are in wet or very wet climates;

-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very deep, have high vegetative cover; occur on nearly level ground, and in semi-dry to mildly wet climates; 

Moderately Fragile (index rating greater than 0.209 and less than or equal to 0.409) – These soils have a moderate potential to resist degradation and be moderately resilient. They are:

-- Poorly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, occur on gentle to very steep slopes, have high vegetative cover, and are in wet or very wet climates; 
-- Weakly structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are deep, occur in nearly level to gently sloping areas, have high vegetative cover, and are in semi-dry climates; or 
-- Weakly structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are very shallow to very deep, occur in nearly level to strongly sloping areas, have high vegetative cover, and are in mildly wet climates.

Fragile (index rating greater than 0.409 and less than or equal to 0.609) – These soils have a low potential to resist degradation and low resilience. They are:
-- Well structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, are shallow to very deep, have moderate to moderately high vegetative cover, occur on steep slopes, and are in dry climates; 
-- Well structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, are shallow to very deep, have a low vegetative cover, occur in nearly level to gently sloping areas, and are in dry climates;

-- Weakly structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, occur on moderately steep to very steep slopes, have low vegetative cover, and are in wet or very wet climates.

Very Fragile (index rating greater than 0.609 and less than or equal to 0.809) – These soils have a very low potential to resist degradation and very low resilience. They are:
-- Weakly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are deep, have low vegetative cover, occur on nearly level to very steep slopes, and are in dry climates;

-- Poorly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are very shallow, have no vegetative cover, occur on steep slopes, and are in mildly wet to wet climates.

Extremely Fragile (index rating greater than 0.809 and less than or equal to 1.0) – These soils can have no potential to resist degradation and no resilience. They are:
-- Poorly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are very shallow, have low vegetative cover, occur on very steep slopes, and are in dry or very dry climates; 
-- Weakly structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are nearly level to very deep, have low vegetative cover, occur on very steep slopes, and are in dry climates; or
-- Very shallow soils on steep slopes.

2694,Soil Susceptibility to Compaction,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Soils are rated based on their susceptibility to compaction from the operation of ground-based equipment for planting, harvesting, and site preparation activities when soils are moist.  Soil compaction is the process in which soil particles are pressed together more closely that in the original state.  Typically, the soil must be moist to be compacted because the mineral grains must slide together.  Compaction reduces the abundance mostly of large pores in the soil by damaging the structure of the soil.  This produces several effects that are unwanted in agricultural soils since large pores are most effective at transmitting water and air through the soil.  Compaction also increases the soil strength which can limit root penetration and growth.  The ability of soil to hold water is adversely affected by compaction since the large pores hold water.  The degree of compaction of a soil is measured by its bulk density, which is the mass per unit volume, generally expressed in grams per cubic centimeter.

Compacted soils are less favorable for good plant growth because of high soil bulk density and hardness, reduced pore space, and poor aeration and drainage. Root penetration and growth is decreased in compacted soils because the hardness or strength of these soils prevents the expansion of roots. Supplies of air, water, and nutrients that roots need are also less favorable when compaction decreases soil porosity and drainage.

Interpretation ratings are based on soil properties in the upper 12 inches of the profile.  Factors considered are soil texture, soil organic matter content, soil structure, rock fragment content, and the existing bulk density.  Each of these is thought to contribute to resisting the susceptibility of a soil to compaction when present.  Organic matter in the soil provides resistance to compaction and the resilience to ameliorate the effects with time.  Soil structure adds strength as discrete aggregates and it is the aggregates that are deformed or destroyed by compactive forces, thus strong soil structure lowers the susceptibility to compaction.  Similarly, rock fragments in the soil can bridge and provide a framework to resist compaction.  Finally, if a soil is already fairly dense causing further compaction is more difficult. 

Definitions of the ratings:

Low - The potential for compaction is insignificant.  This soil is able to support standard equipment with minimal compaction. The soil is moisture insensitive, exhibiting only small changes in density with changing moisture content.

Medium - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings may be reduced following compaction.  After the initial compaction (i.e., the first equipment pass), this soil is able to support standard equipment with only minimal increases in soil density.  The soil is intermediate between moisture insensitive and moisture sensitive.

High - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings will be reduced following compaction.  After initial compaction, this soil is still able to support standard equipment, but will continue to compact with each subsequent pass.  The soil is moisture sensitive, exhibiting large changes in density with changing moisture content.

2712,Farm and Garden Composting Facility - Surface,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Composting is a method of using natural processes to change vegetative debris into a useful product. This interpretation evaluates the degree and kind of limitation(s) that affect the siting of a surface composting facility to stabilize vegetative debris produced as a result of typical farming and horticultural practices. 

The soil is evaluated from the surface to a depth of 79 inches. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect trafficability; attenuation of suspended, soil solution, and gaseous decomposition products and microorganisms; construction and maintenance of the site; and public health. Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater. 

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations. Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate. Soils that have high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), that are shallow to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan, or that have a high content of stones and boulders are limited because these features interfere with the installation, performance, and maintenance of the system. Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the facility.

Climatic factors influence the ease with which a composting facility can be maintained. Adequate precipitation to keep the mass moist, and sufficient heat to sustain biological activity are essential. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest limitation on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00). 

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system on these soils. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.
